301~305
========================

301.Which of the following annotations relate to security in a servlet? 

	(i) @WebSecurity
	(ii) @RolesAllowed

A. (i) only

B. (i) and (iii)

C. (iv) and (v)

D. (iii) and (v)

E. (ii) and (iv)

答案：C

備註：@RolesAllowed其實也跟安全性有關，不能選它的原因可能有兩個

1. @ServletSecurity跟@HttpConstraint是合在一起使用的
2. @RolesAllowed是屬於javax.annotation.security套件，並非是Servlet專屬，@ServletSecurity跟@HttpConstraint是屬於javax.servlet.annotation套件

304.A popular Ajax framework and its companion widget library contain several hundreds of files of different types (.js, .ess, .html). Your company has mandated that all its web applications use only specific versions of this framework approved by IT and repackaged internally as jar files. Furthermore, web applications should only include the entire jar, without subsetting or modification.

Where should the framework's files be placed inside a jar file to enable this kind of reuse?

A. under resources

B. under META-INF/resources

C. under META-INF/web-contents

D. under WEB-INF/resources

答案：B

備註：JAR檔當中的靜態資源(如.js、.html...)應該放在META-INF/resources底下，根據Servlet規格書

The getResource and getResourceAsStream methods take a String with a leading
“/” as an argument that gives the path of the resource relative to the root of the
context or relative to the META-INF/resources directory of a JAR file inside the
web application’s WEB-INF/lib directory. These methods will first search the root
of the web application context for the requested resource before looking at any of the
JAR files in the WEB-INF/lib directory. The order in which the JAR files in the
WEB-INF/lib directory are scanned is undefined. This hierarchy of documents may
exist in the server’s file system, in a Web application archive file, on a remote server,
or at some other location.
